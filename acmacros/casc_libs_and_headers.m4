dnl * CASC_ADD_LIB(LIBRARY, FUNCTION, DIRECTORY-LIST[, PREFIX[, 
dnl *              ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]]])
dnl * checks first if LIBRARY is available on the linking search path and
dnl * if FUNCTION can be linked with LIBRARY.  If so, -lLIBRARY is added
dnl * to the variable [PREFIX]LIBS. (i.e., if prefix is LD, -llibrary is
dnl * added to LDLIBS.)  If not, checks whitespace-separated
dnl * DIRECTORY-LIST to see if LIBRARY exists in a specified directory and
dnl * can be linked with FUNCTION.  If so, the first directory where
dnl * linking is successful is added to the front of [PREFIX]LIBDIRS, and
dnl * -lLIBRARY is added to the end of [PREFIX]LIBS.  If no prefix is
dnl * specified, the directories and libraries are added to LIBS and
dnl * LIBDIRS, respectively.  If the order of -l flags on the linking
dnl * lines is important, CASC_ADD_LIB should be called for each library
dnl * in the order they should appear on linking lines.  Mere existence of
dnl * LIBRARY in the search path or in a specified directory can usually
dnl * be determined by entering 'main' for FUNCTION.  Optional argument
dnl * ACTION-IF-FOUND contains additional instructions to execute as soon
dnl * as LIBRARY is found in any directory.  Optional argument
dnl * ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND contains instructions to execute if LIBRARY is

dnl * CASC_CREATE_PACKAGE_OPTION(PACKAGE-NAME[, DIR-LIST[, FILE]])
dnl * This is a general macro that creates a configure command-line option
dnl * called `--with-PACKAGE-NAME-dir' which will allow the user to
dnl * specify the location of the installation of an outside software
dnl * package, such as PETSc or ISIS++.  After a check to make sure the
dnl * given directory is valid (see below for discussion of validity), the
dnl * directory's path is stored in the shell variable PACKAGE-NAME_DIR.
dnl * For example, to allow the user to specify the location of PETSc,
dnl * place `CASC_CREATE_PACKAGE_OPTION(PETSC)' in configure.in.  Then the
dnl * user, if configuring on the CASC Sun cluster, would type `configure
dnl * --with-PETSC-dir=/home/casc/petsc', and the directory's path would
dnl * be stored in PETSC_DIR.  With this macro, the user is also permitted
dnl * to set the variable PACKAGE-NAME_DIR in the environment before
dnl * running configure, but any choice made on the command line would
dnl * override any preset values.  
dnl *
dnl * This macro takes an optional second argument, DIR-LIST, which is a
dnl * whitespace-separated list of directories where the developer thinks
dnl * PACKAGE-NAME might be installed.  If DIR-LIST is given, and the user
dnl * does not use the `--with' option to give the location of
dnl * PACKAGE-NAME (or if the directory given by the user does not exist),
dnl * then configure will assign to PACKAGE-NAME_DIR the path of the first
dnl * directory in DIR-LIST that is valid.
dnl *
dnl * Validity:  The optional third argument to this macro is FILE, which
dnl * should be either the name of a file in the top directory of the
dnl * package in question or the relative path of a file in a subdirectory
dnl * of the package.  If the argument FILE is given, then configure will
dnl * consider a user specified directory or a directory from DIR-LIST 
dnl * valid only if FILE exists in the directory.  If this argument is not
dnl * given, then configure will consider a directory valid simply if it
dnl * is indeed a directory.  FILE should be a file with a unique name
dnl * that can be expected to exist in the same location in any 
dnl * installation of the package in question.  If you know of no such
dnl * file, do not include a third argument when invoking this macro.
dnl * 
dnl * This macro also gives the user the command-line option
dnl * `--without-PACKAGE-NAME-dir', which, when invoked, will leave the
dnl * variable PACKAGE-NAME_DIR empty.  This option should be invoked when
dnl * the user wants to exclude a package from the configuration.
dnl * 
dnl * NOTE:  Since PACKAGE-NAME is used as part of both a command-line
dnl * option and a variable name, it MUST consist of only alphanumeric
dnl * characters.  PACKAGE-NAME is only a label, so it need not conform to
dnl * any existing directory or file name.  I would recommend that it be
dnl * all caps, as it becomes part of the name of a variable that is
dnl * substituted into the Makefile.

dnl Allow argument for optional libraries; wraps AC_ARG_WITH, to

dnl is presumed to be a library name.  The argument given by the user
dnl (i.e. "bar" in ./configure --with-foo-lib=bar) may be one of four 
dnl things:
dnl     * boolean (no, yes or blank): whether to use library or not
dnl     * file: assumed to be the name of the library
dnl     * directory: assumed to *contain* the library
dnl     * a quoted, space-separated list of linker flags needed to link
dnl       with this library.  (To be used if this library requires
dnl       linker flags other than the normal `-L' and `-l' flags.)
dnl 
dnl The argument is sanity-checked.  If all is well, two variables are
dnl set: "with_foo" (value is yes, no, or maybe), and "foo_LIBFLAGS" (value
dnl is either blank, a file, -lfoo, '-L/some/dir -lfoo', or whatever 
dnl linker flags the user gives). The idea is: the first tells you whether
dnl the library is to be used or not (or the user didn't specify one way
dnl or the other) and the second to put on the command line for linking
dnl with the library.

dnl smr_CHECK_LIB from FVWM by S. Robbins
dnl Probe for an optional library.  This macro creates both
dnl --with-foo-lib and --with-foo-include options for the configure
dnl script.  If --with-foo-lib is *not* specified, the default is to
dnl probe for the library, and use it if found.
dnl
dnl Usage:
dnl smr_CHECK_LIB(name, libname, desc, func, header, x-libs, x-flags)
dnl 
dnl name        name for --with options
dnl libname     (optional) real name of library, if different from
dnl             above
dnl desc        (optional) short descr. of library, for help string
dnl func        function of library, to probe for
dnl header      (optional) header required for using library
dnl x-libs      (optional) extra libraries, if needed to link with lib
dnl x-flags     (optional) extra flags, if needed to include header files
dnl
dnl Changes:  identifier names and documentation modified to reflect
dnl           changes to smr_ARG_WITHLIB and smr_ARG_WITHINCLUDES
