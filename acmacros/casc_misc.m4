dnl * CASC_CONFIG_OUTPUT_LIST(DIR-LIST[, OUTPUT-FILE])
dnl *
dnl * The intent of this macro is to make configure handle the possibility
dnl * that a portion of the directory tree of a project may not be
dnl * present.  This will modify the argument list of AC_OUTPUT to contain
dnl * only output file names for which corresponding input files exist.
dnl * If you are not concerned about the possible absence of the necessary
dnl * input (.in) files, it is better to not use this macro and to
dnl * explicitly list all of the output files in a call to AC_OUTPUT.
dnl * Also, If you wish to create a file Foo from a file with a name
dnl * other than Foo.in, this macro will not work, and you must use
dnl * AC_OUTPUT.
dnl *
dnl * This macro checks for the existence of the file OUTPUT-FILE.in in
dnl * each directory specified in the whitespace-separated DIR-LIST.  
dnl * (Directories should be specified by relative path from the directory 
dnl * containing configure.in.) If OUTPUT-FILE is not specified, the
dnl * default is 'Makefile'.  For each directory that contains 
dnl * OUTPUT-FILE.in, the relative path of OUTPUT-FILE is added to the 
dnl * shell variable OUTPUT-FILE_list.  When AC_OUTPUT is called,
dnl * '$OUTPUT-FILE_list' should be included in the argument list.  So if
dnl * you have a directory tree and each subdirectory contains a 
dnl * Makefile.in, DIR-LIST should be a list of every subdirectory and
dnl * OUTPUT-FILE can be omitted, because 'Makefile' is the default.  When
dnl * configure runs, it will check for the existence of a Makefile.in in
dnl * each directory in DIR-LIST, and if so, the relative path of each
dnl * intended Makefile will be added to the variable Makefile_list.
dnl *
dnl * This macro can be called multiple times, if there are files other
dnl * than Makefile.in with a .in suffix other that are intended to be 
dnl * processed by configure. 
dnl *
dnl * Example
dnl *     If directories dir1 and dir2 both contain a file named Foo.in, 
dnl *     and you wish to use configure to create a file named Foo in each
dnl *     directory, then call 
dnl *     CASC_CONFIG_OUTPUT_LIST(dir1 dir2, Foo)
dnl *     If you also called this macro for Makefile as described above,
dnl *     you should call
dnl *     AC_OUTPUT($Makefile_list $Foo_list)
dnl *     at the end of configure.in .

dnl * CASC_SET_SUFFIX_RULES is not like the other macros in aclocal.m4
dnl * because it does not run any kind of test on the system on which it
dnl * is running.  All it does is create several variables which contain
dnl * the text of some simple implicit suffix rules that can be
dnl * substituted into Makefile.in.  The suffix rules that come from the
dnl * macro all deal with compiling a source file into an object file.  If
dnl * this macro is called in configure.in, then if `@CRULE@' is placed in
dnl * Makefile.in, the following will appear in the generated Makefile:
dnl *
dnl * .c.o:
dnl *         @echo "Making (c) " $@ 
dnl *         @${CC} -o $@ -c ${CFLAGS} $<	
dnl *
dnl * The following is a list of the variables created by this macro and
dnl * the corresponding suffixes of the files that each implicit rule 
dnl * deals with.
dnl *
dnl * CRULE       --   .c
dnl * CXXRULE     --   .cxx
dnl * CPPRULE     --   .cpp
dnl * CCRULE      --   .cc
dnl * CAPCRULE    --   .C
dnl * F77RULE     --   .f
dnl *
dnl * There are four suffix rules for C++ files because of the different
dnl * suffixes that can be used for C++.  Only use the one which
dnl * corresponds to the suffix you use for your C++ files.
dnl *
dnl * The rules created by this macro require you to use the following
dnl * conventions for Makefile variables:
dnl *
dnl * CC        = C compiler
dnl * CXX       = C++ compiler
dnl * F77       = Fortran 77 compiler
dnl * CFLAGS    = C compiler flags
dnl * CXXFLAGS  = C++ compiler flags
