# ParFlow Technical Manual

**February 2026**

**Authors:** Reed Maxwell, Laura Condon, and the ParFlow development team

This technical manual complements the [User Manual](https://parflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and provides detailed descriptions of ParFlow physics that link to the source code. It is intended for research software engineers and applied mathematicians who want a deeper understanding of ParFlow internals.
