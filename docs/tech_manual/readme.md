This document is a technical manual that complements the [User Manual](https://parflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and provides more detailed descriptions of ParFlow physics that link to the source code.  This manual also provides some documentation that might help research software engineers or applied mathematicians who want a better understanding of the ParFlow to expand and develop the code. It is organized into the following sections.

## ParFlow
### [Code Flow and Structure of Solver Richards](Richards_Code_Flow.md)  
### [Physics for Solver Richards and Overland Flow](Richards_Physics.md)
### [Nonlinear Solver Richards and Overland Flow](Richards_Solver.md)

## CLM
### [Code Flow and Structure for CLM]
### [CLM Evaporation and Transpiration]
### [CLM Snow Physics](CLM_Snow_Code_Flow.md)


Note: *Claude Code assisted in aspects of this tech manual such as automating diagrams of code flow, connecting model physics to sections of code, checking consistency and links, and proofreading.*
