.. _ParFlow Input Keys:

ParFlow Input Keys
==================

The basic idea behind ParFlow input is a simple database of keys. The database
contains entries which have a key and a value associated with that key. When ParFlow runs, it queries the database you
have created by key names to get the values you have specified.

The commands ``pfset`` in TCL or ``<runname>.Key=`` in Python are used to create the database entries. 
A simple ParFlow input script contains a long list of these commands that set key values.  Note that the ``<runname>`` is the name a user gives to their run, and is a unique identifier to organize the key database and to anchor the files ParFlow writes.

It should be noted that the keys are “dynamic” in that many are built up
from values of other keys. For example if you have two wells named
*northwell* and *southwell* then you will have to set some keys which
specify the parameters for each well. The keys are built up in a simple
sort of heirarchy.

The following sections contain a description of all of the keys used by
ParFlow. For an example of input files you can look at the ``test`` subdirectory 
of the ParFlow distribution. Looking over some examples should give you 
a good feel for how the file scripts are put together.

Each key entry has the form:

*type* **KeyName** default value Description

The “type” is one of integer, double, string, list. Integer and double
are IEEE numbers. String is a text string (for example, a filename).
Strings can contain spaces if you use the proper TCL syntax (i.e. using
double quotes). These types are standard TCL types. Lists are strings
but they indicate the names of a series of items. For example you might
need to specify the names of the geometries. You would do this using
space seperated names (what we are calling a list) “layer1 layer2
layer3”.

The descriptions that follow are organized into functional areas. An
example for each database entry is given.

Note that units used for each physical quantity specified in the input
file must be consistent with units used for all other quantities. The
exact units used can be any consistent set as ParFlow does not assume
any specific set of units. However, it is up to the user to make sure
all specifications are indeed consistent.

.. _Input File Format Number:

Input File Format Number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*integer* **FileVersion** no default This gives the value of the input
file version number that this file fits.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset FileVersion 4           ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.FileVersion = 4     ## Python syntax

As development of the ParFlow code continues, the input file format will
vary. We have thus included an input file format number as a way of
verifying that the correct format type is being used. The user can check
in the ``parflow/config/file_versions.h`` file to verify that the format 
number specified in the input file matches the defined value 
of  ``PFIN_VERSION``.

.. _Computing Topology:

Computing Topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how processors are assigned in order to solve the
domain in parallel. “P” allocates the number of processes to the
grid-cells in x. “Q” allocates the number of processes to the grid-cells
in y. “R” allocates the number of processes to the grid-cells in z.
Please note “R” should always be 1 if you are running with Solver
Richards :cite:p:`Jones-Woodward01` unless you’re running a
totally saturated domain (solver IMPES).

*integer* **Process.Topology.P** no default This assigns the process
splits in the *x* direction.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset Process.Topology.P        2   ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.Process.Topology.P = 2    ## Python syntax

*integer* **Process.Topology.Q** no default This assigns the process
splits in the *y* direction.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset Process.Topology.Q       1   ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.Process.Topology.Q = 1   ## Python syntax

*integer* **Process.Topology.R** no default This assigns the process
splits in the *z* direction.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset Process.Topology.R       1   ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.Process.Topology.R = 1   ## Python syntax

In addition, you can assign the computing topology when you initiate
your parflow script using tcl. You must include the topology allocation
when using tclsh and the parflow script.

Example Usage (in TCL):

::

   [from Terminal] tclsh default_single.tcl 2 1 1

   [At the top of default_single.tcl you must include the following]
   set NP  [lindex $argv 0]
   set NQ  [lindex $argv 1]

   pfset Process.Topology.P        $NP
   pfset Process.Topology.Q        $NQ
   pfset Process.Topology.R        1 

.. _Computational Grid:

Computational Grid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The computational grid is briefly described in
:ref:`Defining the Problem`. The computational grid keys set the
bottom left corner of the domain to a specific point in space. If using
a ``.pfsol`` file, the bottom left corner location of the ``.pfsol`` file must
be the points designated in the computational grid. The user can also
assign the *x*, *y* and *z* location to correspond to a specific
coordinate system (i.e. UTM).

*double* **ComputationalGrid.Lower.X** no default This assigns the lower
*x* coordinate location for the computational grid.

.. container:: list

grid cells in the *z* direction for the computational grid.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset  ComputationalGrid.NZ  10        ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.ComputationalGrid.NZ = 10    ## Python syntax

*real* **ComputationalGrid.DX** no default This defines the size of grid
cells in the *x* direction. Units are *L* and are defined by the units
of the hydraulic conductivity used in the problem.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset  ComputationalGrid.DX  10.0      ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.ComputationalGrid.DX = 10.0  ## Python syntax

*real* **ComputationalGrid.DY** no default This defines the size of grid
cells in the *y* direction. Units are *L* and are defined by the units
of the hydraulic conductivity used in the problem.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset  ComputationalGrid.DY  10.0         ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.ComputationalGrid.DY = 10.0     ## Python syntax

*real* **ComputationalGrid.DZ** no default This defines the size of grid
cells in the *z* direction. Units are *L* and are defined by the units
of the hydraulic conductivity used in the problem.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset  ComputationalGrid.DZ  1.0       ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.ComputationalGrid.DZ = 1.0   ## Python syntax

Example Usage (TCL):

::

   #---------------------------------------------------------
   # Computational Grid
   #---------------------------------------------------------
   pfset ComputationalGrid.Lower.X	-10.0
   pfset ComputationalGrid.Lower.Y     10.0
   pfset ComputationalGrid.Lower.Z	1.0

   pfset ComputationalGrid.NX		18
   pfset ComputationalGrid.NY		18
   pfset ComputationalGrid.NZ		8

   pfset ComputationalGrid.DX		8.0

   <runname>.ComputationalGrid.DX   = 8.0
   <runname>.ComputationalGrid.DY	= 10.0
   <runname>.ComputationalGrid.DZ	= 1.0

*string* **UseClustering** True Run a clustering algorithm to create
boxes in index space for iteration. By default an octree representation
is used for iteration, this may result in iterating over many nodes in
the octree. The **UseClustering** key will run a clustering algorithm to
build a set of boxes for iteration.

This does not always have a significant impact on performance and the
clustering algorithm can be expensive to compute. For small problems and
short running problems clustering is not recommended. Long running
problems may or may not see a benefit. The result varies significantly
based on the geometries in the problem.

The Berger-Rigoutsos algorithm is currently used for clustering.

::

   pfset UseClustering False         ## TCL syntax

   <runname>.UseClustering = False     ## Python syntax

.. _Geometries:

Geometries
~~~~~~~~~~

Here we define all “geometrical” information needed by ParFlow. For
example, the domain (and patches on the domain where boundary conditions
are to be imposed), lithology or hydrostratigraphic units, faults,
initial plume shapes, and so on, are considered geometries.

This input section is a little confusing. Two items are being specified,
geometry inputs and geometries. A geometry input is a type of geometry
input (for example a box or an input file). A geometry input can contain
more than one geometry. A geometry input of type Box has a single
geometry (the square box defined by the extants of the two points). A
SolidFile input type can contain several geometries.

*list* **GeomInput.Names** no default This is a list of the geometry
input names which define the containers for all of the geometries
defined for this problem.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset GeomInput.Names    "solidinput indinput boxinput"     ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.GeomInput.Names = "solidinput indinput boxinput"  ## Python syntax

*string* **GeomInput.\ *geom_input_name*.InputType** no default This
defines the input type for the geometry input with *geom_input_name*.
This key must be one of: **SolidFile, IndicatorField**, **Box**.

.. container:: list

   ::
 
      pfset GeomInput.solidinput.InputType  "SolidFile"        ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.GeomInput.solidinput.InputType  = "SolidFile"  ## Python syntax

*list* **GeomInput.\ *geom_input_name*.GeomNames** no default This is a
list of the names of the geometries defined by the geometry input. For a
geometry input type of Box, the list should contain a single geometry
name. For the SolidFile geometry type this should contain a list with
the same number of gemetries as were defined using GMS. The order of
geometries in the SolidFile should match the names. For IndicatorField
types you need to specify the value in the input field which matches the
name using GeomInput.\ *geom_input_name*.Value.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset GeomInput.solidinput.GeomNames "domain bottomlayer \
                                            middlelayer toplayer"  ## TCL syntax
      
      <runname>.GeomInput.solidinput.GeomNames = "domain bottomlayer middlelayer toplayer"  ## Python syntax

*string* **GeomInput.\ *geom_input_name*.Filename** no default For
IndicatorField and SolidFile geometry inputs this key specifies the
input filename which contains the field or solid information.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset GeomInput.solidinput.FileName   "ocwd.pfsol"       ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.GeomInput.solidinput.FileName = "ocwd.pfsol"   ## Python syntax

*integer* **GeomInput.\ *geometry_input_name*.Value** no default For
IndicatorField geometry inputs you need to specify the mapping between
values in the input file and the geometry names. The named geometry will
be defined whereever the input file is equal to the specifed value.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset GeomInput.sourceregion.Value   11      ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.GeomInput.sourceregion.Value = 11  ## Python syntax

For box geometries you need to specify the location of the box. This is
done by defining two corners of the the box.

*double* **Geom.\ *box_geom_name*.Lower.X** no default This gives the
lower X real space coordinate value of the previously specified box
geometry of name *box_geom_name*.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset Geom.background.Lower.X   -1.0         ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.Geom.background.Lower.X = -1.0     ## Python syntax

*double* **Geom.\ *box_geom_name*.Lower.Y** no default This gives the
lower Y real space coordinate value of the previously specified box
geometry of name *box_geom_name*.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset Geom.background.Lower.Y   -1.0         ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.Geom.background.Lower.Y = -1.0     ## Python syntax

*double* **Geom.\ *box_geom_name*.Lower.Z** no default This gives the
lower Z real space coordinate value of the previously specified box
geometry of name *box_geom_name*.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset Geom.background.Lower.Z   -1.0         ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.Geom.background.Lower.Z = -1.0     ## Python syntax

*double* **Geom.\ *box_geom_name*.Upper.X** no default This gives the
upper X real space coordinate value of the previously specified box
geometry of name *box_geom_name*.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset Geom.background.Upper.X   151.0        ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.Geom.background.Upper.X = 151.0    ## Python syntax

*double* **Geom.\ *box_geom_name*.Upper.Y** no default This gives the
upper Y real space coordinate value of the previously specified box
geometry of name *box_geom_name*.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset Geom.background.Upper.Y   171.0        ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.Geom.background.Upper.Y = 171.0    ## Python syntax

*double* **Geom.\ *box_geom_name*.Upper.Z** no default This gives the
upper Z real space coordinate value of the previously specified box
geometry of name *box_geom_name*.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset Geom.background.Upper.Z   11.0         ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.Geom.background.Upper.Z = 11.0     ## Python syntax

*list* **Geom.\ *geom_name*.Patches** no default Patches are defined on
the surfaces of geometries. Currently you can only define patches on Box
geometries and on the the first geometry in a SolidFile. For a Box the
order is fixed (left right front back bottom top) but you can name the
sides anything you want.

For SolidFiles the order is printed by the conversion routine that
converts GMS to SolidFile format.

.. container:: list

      pfset Geom.background.Patches   "left right front back bottom top"      ## TCL syntax

Here is an example geometry input section which has three geometry
inputs (TCL).

.. _Reservoirs:

Reservoirs
~~~~~~~~~~
Here we define reservoirs for the model. Currently reservoirs have only been tested on domains
where the top of domain lies at the top of the grid. This applies to all box domains and some 
terrain following grid domains. The format for this section of input
is:

*string* **Reservoirs.Names** no default This key specifies the names of the
reservoirs for which input data will be given.

.. container:: list

   ::

      Reservoirs.Names "reservoir_1 reservoir_2 reservoir_3"

*double* **Reservoirs.\ *reservoir_name*.Release_X** no default This key specifies 
the x location of where the reservoir releases water. This cell will always be placed
on the domain surface.

*double* **Reservoirs.\ *reservoir_name*.Release_Y** no default This key specifies 
the y location of where the reservoir releases water. This cell will always be placed
on the domain surface.

*double* **Reservoirs.\ *reservoir_name*.Intake_X** no default This key specifies 
the x location of where the reservoir intakes water. This cell will always be placed
on the domain surface.

*double* **Reservoirs.\ *reservoir_name*.Intake_Y** no default This key specifies 
the y location of where the reservoir intakes water. This cell will always be placed
on the domain surface.

.. This value is set as an int because bools do not work with the table reader right now
*int* **Reservoirs.\ *reservoir_name*.Has_Secondary_Intake_Cell** no default This key specifies if 
the reservoir has a secondary intake cell, with 0 evaluating to false and 1 evaluating to true. This
cell will always be placed on the domain surface.

*double* **Reservoirs.\ *reservoir_name*.Secondary_Intake_X** no default This optional key 
specifies the x location of where the reservoir's secondary intake cell intakes water. This 
cell will always be placed on the domain surface. This key is only used when the reservoir has
a secondary intake cell, in which case it is required.

*double* **Reservoirs.\ *reservoir_name*.Secondary_Intake_Y** no default This optional key 
specifies the y location of where the reservoir's secondary intake cell intakes water. This 
cell will always be placed on the domain surface. This key is only used when the reservoir has
a secondary intake cell, in which case it is required.

*double* **Reservoirs.\ *reservoir_name*.Min_Release_Storage** no default This key specifies 
the storage amount below which the reservoir will stop releasing water. Has units [L\ :sup:`3`].

*double* **Reservoirs.\ *reservoir_name*.Max_Storage** no default This key specifies a reservoirs 
maximum storage. If storage rises above this value, a reservoir will release extra water if necessary
to get back down to this amount by the next timestep. Has units [L\ :sup:`3`]

*double* **Reservoirs.\ *reservoir_name*.Storage** no default This key specifies the amount of water 
stored in the reservoir as a volume. Has same length units as the problem domain i.e. if domain is 
sized in meters this will be in m\ :sup:`3`.

*double* **Reservoirs.\ *reservoir_name*.Release_Rate** no default [Type: double] This key specifies 
the rate in volume/time [L\ :sup:`3` \ :sup:`-1`] that the reservoir release water. The amount of time over which 
this amount is released is independent of solver timestep size.

Overland_Flow_Solver

*string* **Reservoirs.Overland_Flow_Solver** no default This key specifies which overland flow 
condition is used in the domain so that the slopes aroundthe reservoirs can be adjusted properly. 
Supported Options are **OverlandFlow** and **OverlandKinematic**.

.. _Timing Information:

Timing Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The data given in the timing section describe all the “temporal”
information needed by ParFlow. The data items are used to describe time
units for later sections, sequence iterations in time, indicate actual
starting and stopping values and give instructions on when data is
printed out.

*double* **TimingInfo.BaseUnit** no default This key is used to indicate
the base unit of time for entering time values. All time should be
expressed as a multiple of this value. This should be set to the
smallest interval of time to be used in the problem. For example, a base
unit of “1” means that all times will be integer valued. A base unit of
“0.5” would allow integers and fractions of 0.5 to be used for time
input values.

The rationale behind this restriction is to allow time to be discretized
on some interval to enable integer arithmetic to be used when
computing/comparing times. This avoids the problems associated with real
value comparisons which can lead to events occurring at different
timesteps on different architectures or compilers.

This value is also used when describing “time cycling data” in,
currently, the well and boundary condition sections. The lengths of the
cycles in those sections will be integer multiples of this value,
therefore it needs to be the smallest divisor which produces an integral
result for every “real time” cycle interval length needed.

.. container:: list

      <runname>.TimingInfo.BaseUnit = 1.0    ## Python syntax

*integer* **TimingInfo.StartCount** no default This key is used to
indicate the time step number that will be associated with the first
advection cycle in a transient problem. The value **-1** indicates that
advection is not to be done. The value **0** indicates that advection
should begin with the given initial conditions. 

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset TimingInfo.StartCount    0       ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.TimingInfo.StartCount = 0    ## Python syntax

*double* **TimingInfo.StartTime** no default This key is used to
indicate the starting time for the simulation.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset TimingInfo.StartTime     0.0     ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.TimingInfo.StartTime = 0.0   ## Python syntax

*double* **TimingInfo.StopTime** no default This key is used to indicate
the stopping time for the simulation.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset TimingInfo.StopTime      100.0      ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.TimingInfo.StopTime = 100.0     ## Python syntax

*double* **TimingInfo.DumpInterval** no default This key is the real
time interval at which time-dependent output should be written. A value
of **0** will produce undefined behavior. If the value is negative,
output will be dumped out every :math:`n` time steps, where :math:`n` is
the absolute value of the integer part of the value.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset TimingInfo.DumpInterval  10.0       ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.TimingInfo.DumpInterval = 10.0  ## Python syntax

*integer* **TimingInfo.DumpIntervalExecutionTimeLimit** 0 This key is
used to indicate a wall clock time to halt the execution of a run. At
the end of each dump interval the time remaining in the batch job is
compared with the user supplied value, if remaining time is less than or
equal to the supplied value the execution is halted. Typically used when
running on batch systems with time limits to force a clean shutdown near
the end of the batch job. Time units is seconds, a value of **0** (the
default) disables the check.

Currently only supported on SLURM based systems, “–with-slurm” must be
specified at configure time to enable.

For *Richards’ equation cases only* input is collected for time step
selection. Input for this section is given as follows:

*list* **TimeStep.Type** no default This key must be one of:
**Constant** or **Growth**. The value **Constant** defines a constant
time step. The value **Growth** defines a time step that starts as
:math:`dt_0` and is defined for other steps as
:math:`dt^{new} = \gamma dt^{old}` such that :math:`dt^{new} \leq 
dt_{max}` and :math:`dt^{new} \geq dt_{min}`.

      <runname>.TimeStep.Type = "Constant"   ## Python syntax

*double* **TimeStep.Value** no default This key is used only if a
constant time step is selected and indicates the value of the time step
for all steps taken.

.. _Permeability:

Permeability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, permeability property values are assigned to grid
points within geometries (specified in :ref:`Geometries` above)
using one of the methods described below. Permeabilities are assumed to
be a diagonal tensor with entries given as,

.. math::

   \left( 
   \begin{array}{ccc}
   k_x({\bf x}) & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & k_y({\bf x}) & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & k_z({\bf x}) 
   \end{array} \right) 
   K({\bf x}),

where :math:`K({\bf x})` is the permeability field given below.
Specification of the tensor entries (:math:`k_x, k_y` and :math:`k_z`)
will be given at the end of this section.

The random field routines (*turning bands* and *pgs*) can use
conditioning data if the user so desires. It is not necessary to use
conditioning as ParFlow automatically defaults to not use conditioning
data, but if conditioning is desired, the following key should be set:

*string* **Perm.Conditioning.FileName** “NA” This key specifies the name
of the file that contains the conditioning data. The default string
**NA** indicates that conditioning data is not applicable.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset Perm.Conditioning.FileName   "well_cond.txt"       ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.Perm.Conditioning.FileName = "well_cond.txt"   ## Python syntax

The file that contains the conditioning data is a simple ascii file
containing points and values. The format is:

.. container:: list

   ::

      nlines
      x1 y1 z1 value1
      x2 y2 z2 value2
      .  .  .    .
      .  .  .    .
      .  .  .    .
      xn yn zn valuen

The value of *nlines* is just the number of lines to follow in the file,
which is equal to the number of data points.

The variables *xi,yi,zi* are the real space coordinates (in the units
used for the given parflow run) of a point at which a fixed permeability
value is to be assigned. The variable *valuei* is the actual
permeability value that is known.

Note that the coordinates are not related to the grid in any way.
Conditioning does not require that fixed values be on a grid. The PGS
algorithm will map the given value to the closest grid point and that
will be fixed. This is done for speed reasons. The conditioned turning
bands algorithm does not do this; conditioning is done for every grid
point using the given conditioning data at the location given. Mapping
to grid points for that algorithm does not give any speedup, so there is
no need to do it.

NOTE: The given values should be the actual measured values - adjustment
in the conditioning for the lognormal distribution that is assumed is
taken care of in the algorithms.

The general format for the permeability input is as follows:

*list* **Geom.Perm.Names** no default This key specifies all of the
geometries to which a permeability field will be assigned. These
geometries must cover the entire computational domain.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset GeomInput.Names   "background domain concen_region"      ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.GeomInput.Names = "background domain concen_region"  ## Python syntax

*string* **Geom.geometry_name.Perm.Type** no default This key specifies
which method is to be used to assign permeability data to the named
geometry, *geometry_name*. It must be either **Constant**,
**TurnBands**, **ParGuass**, or **PFBFile**. The **Constant** value
indicates that a constant is to be assigned to all grid cells within a
geometry. The **TurnBand** value indicates that Tompson’s Turning Bands
method is to be used to assign permeability data to all grid cells
within a geometry :cite:p:`TAG89`. The **ParGauss** value
indicates that a Parallel Gaussian Simulator method is to be used to
assign permeability data to all grid cells within a geometry. The
**PFBFile** value indicates that premeabilities are to be read from a 
ParFlow 3D binary file. Both the Turning Bands and Parallel Gaussian
Simulators generate a random field with correlation lengths in the
:math:`3` spatial directions given by :math:`\lambda_x`,
:math:`\lambda_y`, and :math:`\lambda_z` with the geometric mean of the
log normal field given by :math:`\mu` and the standard deviation of the
normal field given by :math:`\sigma`. In generating the field both of
these methods can be made to stratify the data, that is follow the top
or bottom surface. The generated field can also be made so that the data
is normal or log normal, with or without bounds truncation. Turning
Bands uses a line process, the number of lines used and the resolution
of the process can be changed as well as the maximum normalized
frequency :math:`K_{\rm max}` and the normalized frequency increment
:math:`\delta K`. The Parallel Gaussian Simulator uses a search
neighborhood, the number of simulated points and the number of
conditioning points can be changed.

*string* **Geom.\ *geometry_name*.Perm.FileName** no default This key
specifies that permeability values for the specified geometry,
*geometry_name*, are given according to a user-supplied description in
the “ParFlow binary” file whose filename is given as the value. For a
description of the ParFlow Binary file format, see
:ref:`ParFlow Binary Files (.pfb)`. The ParFlow binary file
associated with the named geometry must contain a collection of
permeability values corresponding in a one-to-one manner to the entire
computational grid. That is to say, when the contents of the file are
read into the simulator, a complete permeability description for the
entire domain is supplied. Only those values associated with
computational cells residing within the geometry (as it is represented
on the computational grid) will be copied into data structures used
during the course of a simulation. Thus, the values associated with
cells outside of the geounit are irrelevant. For clarity, consider a
couple of different scenarios. For example, the user may create a file
for each geometry such that appropriate permeability values are given
for the geometry and “garbage" values (e.g., some flag value) are given
for the rest of the computational domain. In this case, a separate
binary file is specified for each geometry. Alternatively, one may place
all values representing the permeability field on the union of the
geometries into a single binary file. Note that the permeability values
must be represented in precisely the same configuration as the

Full Multiphase Mobilities

Here we define phase mobilities by specifying the relative permeability

are used. See the next section for the correct Richards’ equation input
format.

*string* **Phase.\ *phase_name*.Mobility.Type** no default This key
specifies whether the mobility for *phase_name* will be a given constant
or a polynomial of the form, :math:`(S - S_0)^{a}`, where :math:`S` is
saturation, :math:`S_0` is irreducible saturation, and :math:`a` is some
exponent. The possibilities for this key are **Constant** and
**Polynomial**.

.. _Richards RelPerm:

Richards’ Equation Relative Permeabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following keys are used to describe relative permeability input for
the Richards’ equation implementation. They will be ignored if a full
two-phase formulation is used.

*string* **Phase.RelPerm.Type** no default This key specifies the type
of relative permeability function that will be used on all specified
geometries. Note that only one type of relative permeability may be used
for the entire problem. However, parameters may be different for that
type in different geometries. For instance, if the problem consists of
three geometries, then **VanGenuchten** may be specified with three
different sets of parameters for the three different goemetries.
However, once **VanGenuchten** is specified, one geometry cannot later
be specified to have **Data** as its relative permeability. The possible
values for this key are **Constant, VanGenuchten, Haverkamp, Data,** and
**Polynomial**.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset Phase.RelPerm.Type   "Constant"        ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.Phase.RelPerm.Type = "Constant"    ## Python syntax

The various possible functions are defined as follows. The **Constant**
specification means that the relative permeability will be constant on
the specified geounit. The **VanGenuchten** specification means that the
relative permeability will be given as a Van Genuchten function
:cite:p:`VanGenuchten80` with the form,

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   k_r(p) = \frac{(1 - \frac{(\alpha p)^{n-1}}{(1 + (\alpha p)^n)^m})^2}
   {(1 + (\alpha p)^n)^{m/2}},\end{aligned}

where :math:`\alpha` and :math:`n` are soil parameters and
:math:`m = 1 - 1/n`, on each region. The **Haverkamp** specification
means that the relative permeability will be given in the following form
:cite:p:`Haverkamp-Vauclin81`,

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   k_r(p) = \frac{A}{A + p^{\gamma}},\end{aligned}

where :math:`A` and :math:`\gamma` are soil parameters, on each region.
The **Data** specification is currently unsupported but will later mean
that data points for the relative permeability curve will be given and
ParFlow will set up the proper interpolation coefficients to get values
between the given data points. The **Polynomial** specification defines
a polynomial relative permeability function for each region of the form,

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   k_r(p) = \sum_{i=0}^{degree} c_ip^i.\end{aligned}

*list* **Phase.RelPerm.GeomNames** no default This key specifies the
geometries on which relative permeability will be given. The union of
these geometries must cover the entire computational domain.

*integer* **Phase.RelPerm.VanGenuchten.File** 0 This key specifies
whether soil parameters for the VanGenuchten function are specified in a
ParFlow 3D binary file or by region. The options are either 0 for specification by
region, or 1 for specification in a file. Note that either all
parameters are specified in files (each has their own input file) or
none are specified by files. Parameters specified by files are:
:math:`\alpha` and N.

*int* **Geom.\ *geom_name*.RelPerm.NumSamplePoints** 0 This key
specifies the number of sample points for a spline base interpolation
table for the Van Genuchten function specified on *geom_name*. If this

NOTE: For all these cases, if only one region is to be used (the
domain), the background region should NOT be set as that single region.
Using the background will prevent the upstream weighting from being
correct near Dirichlet boundaries.

.. _Phase Sources:

Phase Sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following keys are used to specify phase source terms. The units of
the source term are :math:`1/T`. So, for example, to specify a region
with constant flux rate of :math:`L^3/T`, one must be careful to convert
this rate to the proper units by dividing by the volume of the enclosing
region. For *Richards’ equation* input, the source term must be given as
a flux multiplied by density.

*string* **PhaseSources.\ *phase_name*.Type** no default This key
specifies the type of source to use for phase *phase_name*. Possible
values for this key are **Constant** and **PredefinedFunction**.
**Constant** type phase sources specify a constant phase source value
for a given set of regions. **PredefinedFunction** type phase sources
use a preset function (choices are listed below) to specify the source.
Note that the **PredefinedFunction** type can only be used to set a
single source over the entire domain and not separate sources over
different regions.

Here we define capillary pressure. Note: this section needs to be

.. _Saturation:

Saturation
~~~~~~~~~~

This section is *only* relevant to the Richards’ equation cases. All
keys relating to this section will be ignored for other cases. The
following keys are used to define the saturation-pressure curve.

*string* **Phase.Saturation.Type** no default This key specifies the
type of saturation function that will be used on all specified
geometries. Note that only one type of saturation may be used for the
entire problem. However, parameters may be different for that type in
different geometries. For instance, if the problem consists of three
geometries, then **VanGenuchten** may be specified with three different
sets of parameters for the three different goemetries. However, once
**VanGenuchten** is specified, one geometry cannot later be specified to
have **Data** as its saturation. The possible values for this key are

The various possible functions are defined as follows. The **Constant**

:math:`s_{res}` is the residual saturation, and :math:`\alpha` and
:math:`n` are soil parameters with :math:`m = 1 - 1/n`, on each region.
The **Haverkamp** specification means that the saturation will be given
in the following form :cite:p:`Haverkamp-Vauclin81`,

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   s(p) = \frac{\A(s_{sat} - s_{res})}{A + p^{\gamma}} + s_{res},\end{aligned}

where :math:`A` and :math:`\gamma` are soil parameters, on each region.
The **Data** specification is currently unsupported but will later mean
that data points for the saturation curve will be given and ParFlow will
set up the proper interpolation coefficients to get values between the
given data points. The **Polynomial** specification defines a polynomial
saturation function for each region of the form,

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   s(p) = \sum_{i=0}^{degree} c_ip^i.\end{aligned}

The **PFBFile** specification means that the saturation will be taken as
a spatially varying but constant in pressure function given by data in a
ParFlow 3D binary file.

geometries on which saturation will be given. The union of these

gridpoint in ParFlow.

NOTE: Currently, ParFlow assumes that internal boundary conditions and
pressure wells are separated by at least one cell from any external

.. _`Boundary Conditions: Pressure`:

Boundary Conditions: Pressure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here we define the pressure boundary conditions. The Dirichlet
conditions below are hydrostatic conditions, and it is assumed that at
each phase interface the pressure is constant. *It is also assumed here
that all phases are distributed within the domain at all times such that
the lighter phases are vertically higher than the heavier phases.*

Boundary condition input is associated with domain patches (see :ref:`Domain`). Note that different patches may have different
types of boundary conditions on them.

*list* **BCPressure.PatchNames** no default This key specifies the names
of patches on which pressure boundary conditions will be specified. Note
that these must all be patches on the external boundary of the domain
and these patches must “cover” that external boundary.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset BCPressure.PatchNames    "left right front back top bottom"

*string* **Patch.\ *patch_name*.BCPressure.Type** no default This key
specifies the type of boundary condition data given for patch
*patch_name*. Possible values for this key are **DirEquilRefPatch,
DirEquilPLinear, FluxConst, FluxVolumetric, PressureFile, FluxFile,
OverlandFow, OverlandFlowPFB, SeepageFace, OverlandKinematic,
OverlandDiffusive** and **ExactSolution**. The choice
**DirEquilRefPatch** specifies that the pressure on the specified patch
will be in hydrostatic equilibrium with a constant reference pressure
given on a reference patch. The choice **DirEquilPLinear** specifies
that the pressure on the specified patch will be in hydrostatic
equilibrium with pressure given along a piecewise line at elevation
:math:`z=0`. The choice **FluxConst** defines a constant normal flux
boundary condition through the domain patch. This flux must be specified
in units of :math:`[L]/[T]`. For *Richards’ equation*, fluxes must be
specified as a mass flux and given as the above flux multiplied by the
density. Thus, this choice of input type for a Richards’ equation
problem has units of :math:`([L]/[T])([M]/[L]^3)`. The choice
**FluxVolumetric** defines a volumetric flux boundary condition through
the domain patch. The units should be consistent with all other user
input for the problem. For *Richards’ equation* fluxes must be specified
as a mass flux and given as the above flux multiplied by the density.
The choice **PressureFile** defines a hydraulic head boundary condition
that is read from a properly distributed ParFlow binary file. Only the values
needed for the patch are used. The choice **FluxFile** defines a flux
boundary condition that is read form a properly distributed ParFlow binary file
defined on a grid consistent with the pressure field grid. Only the
values needed for the patch are used. The choices **OverlandFlow** and
**OverlandFlowPFB** both turn on fully-coupled overland flow routing as
described in :cite:t:`KM06` and :ref:`Overland Flow`. The key **OverlandFlow**
corresponds to a **Value** key with a positive or negative value, to
indicate uniform fluxes (such as rainfall or evapotranspiration) over
the entire domain while the key **OverlandFlowPFB** allows a ParFlow 2D binary file to
contain grid-based, spatially-variable fluxes. The **OverlandKinematic**
and **OverlandDiffusive** both turn on a kinematic and diffusive wave
overland flow routing boundary that solve Maning's equation in
:ref:`Overland Flow` and do the upwinding internally
(i.e. assuming that the user provides cell face slopes, as opposed to
the traditional cell centered slopes). The key **SeepageFace** simulates
a boundary that allows flow to exit but keeps the surface pressure at
zero. Consider a sign flip in top boundary condition values (i.e., outgoing
fluxes are positve and incomming fluxes are negative). The choice
**ExactSolution** specifies that an exact known
solution is to be applied as a Dirichlet boundary condition on the
respective patch. Note that this does not change according to any cycle.
Instead, time dependence is handled by evaluating at the time the
boundary condition value is desired. The solution is specified by using
a predefined function (choices are described below). NOTE: These last
six types of boundary condition input is for *Richards’ equation cases
only!*

Multiple wells assigned to one grid location can occur in several
instances. The current actions taken by the code are as follows:

-  If multiple pressure wells are assigned to one grid cell, the code
   retains only the last set of overlapping well values entered.

-  If multiple flux wells are assigned to one grid cell, the code sums
   the contributions of all overlapping wells to get one effective well
   flux.

-  If multiple pressure and flux wells are assigned to one grid cell,
   the code retains the last set of overlapping hydrostatic pressure
   values entered and sums all the overlapping flux well values to get
   an effective pressure/flux well value.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to input keys related to the physics capabilities and
modeling specifics there are some key values used by various algorithms
and general control flags for ParFlow. These are described next :

*string* **Solver.Linear** PCG This key specifies the linear solver used
for solver **IMPES**. Choices for this key are **MGSemi, PPCG, PCG** and
**CGHS**. The choice **MGSemi** is an algebraic mulitgrid linear solver
(not a preconditioned conjugate gradient) which may be less robust than
**PCG** as described in :cite:t:`Ashby-Falgout90`. The choice
**PPCG** is a preconditioned conjugate gradient solver. The choice
**PCG** is a conjugate gradient solver with a multigrid preconditioner.
The choice **CGHS** is a conjugate gradient solver.

      <runname>.Solver.AdvectOrder = 2    ## Python syntax

*double* **Solver.CFL** 0.7 This key gives the value of the weight put
on the computed CFL limit before computing a global timestep value.
Values greater than 1 are not suggested and in fact because this is an
approximation, values slightly less than 1 can also produce
instabilities.

written to PFSB files. Data values greater than the negative of this
value and less than the value itself are treated as zero and not written
to PFSB files.

      turn on printing of the initial conditions.  This includes the
      pressure, saturation, slopes, etc.  By default the initial
      conditions output is generated before the first time
      advancement; when doing a restart this leads to a duplication
      of files on each restart.  Setting this key to False will
      prevent the duplication.

      Note setting this key to False overrides the other individual
      output flags that are enabled.

printing of the x, y, and z velocity (Darcy flux) data. The printing of
the data is controlled by values in the timing information section. The
x, y, and z data are written to separate ParFlow binary files. The dimensions of
these files are slightly different than most PF data, with the dimension
of interest representing interfaces, and the other two dimensions
representing cells. E.g. the x-velocity PFB has dimensions [NX+1, NY,
NZ]. This key produces files in the format of
``<runname>.out.phase<x||y||z>.00.0000.pfb`` when using ParFlow’s saturated

This key specifies optional modifications to the terrain following grid
formulation described in :ref:`TFG`. Choices for
this key are **Original, Upwind, UpwindSine**. **Original** is the
original TFG formulation documented in :cite:p:`M13`.
The **Original** option calculates the :math:`\theta_x` and
:math:`\theta_y` for a cell face as the average of the two adjacent cell
slopes (i.e. assuming a cell centered slope calculation). The **Upwind**
option uses the the :math:`\theta_x` and :math:`\theta_y` of a cell
directly without averaging (i.e. assuming a face centered slope
calculation). The **UpwindSine** is the same as the **Upwind** option
but it also removes the Sine term from the TFG Darcy Formulation (in :ref:`TFG`).
Note the **UpwindSine** option is for experimental purposes only and
should not be used in standard simulations. Also note that the choice of
**upwind** or **Original** formulation should consistent with the
choice of overland flow boundary condition if overland flow is being
used. The **upwind** and **UpwindSine** are consistent with
**OverlandDiffusive** and **OverlandKinematic** while **Original** is
consistent with **OverlandFow**

writing to PDB and HDF5 file formats. SILO also allows data compression
to be used, which can save signicant amounts of disk space for some

Richards’ Equation Solver Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following keys are used to specify various parameters used by the
linear and nonlinear solvers in the Richards’ equation implementation.
For information about these solvers, see :cite:t:`Woodward98`
and :cite:t:`Ashby-Falgout90`.

*double* **Solver.Nonlinear.ResidualTol** 1e-7 This key specifies the
tolerance that measures how much the relative reduction in the nonlinear
residual should be before nonlinear iterations stop. The magnitude of
the residual is measured with the :math:`l^1` (max) norm.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset Solver.Nonlinear.ResidualTol   1e-4          ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.Solver.Nonlinear.ResidualTol = 1e-4      ## Python syntax

*double* **Solver.Nonlinear.StepTol** 1e-7 This key specifies the
tolerance that measures how small the difference between two consecutive
nonlinear steps can be before nonlinear iterations stop.

      pfset Solver.Nonlinear.StepTol   1e-4        ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.Solver.Nonlinear.StepTol = 1e-4    ## Python syntax

*integer* **Solver.Nonlinear.MaxIter** 15 This key specifies the maximum
number of nonlinear iterations allowed before iterations stop with a
convergence failure.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset Solver.Nonlinear.MaxIter   50       ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.Solver.Nonlinear.MaxIter = 50   ## Python syntax

*integer* **Solver.Linear.KrylovDimension** 10 This key specifies the
maximum number of vectors to be used in setting up the Krylov subspace
in the GMRES iterative solver. These vectors are of problem size and it
should be noted that large increases in this parameter can limit problem
sizes. However, increasing this parameter can sometimes help nonlinear
solver convergence.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset Solver.Linear.KrylovDimension   15        ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.Solver.Linear.KrylovDimension = 15    ## Python syntax

*integer* **Solver.Linear.MaxRestarts** 0 This key specifies the number
of restarts allowed to the GMRES solver. Restarts start the development
of the Krylov subspace over using the current iterate as the initial
iterate for the next pass.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset Solver.Linear.MaxRestarts   2       ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.Solver.Linear.MaxRestarts = 2   ## Python syntax

*integer* **Solver.MaxConvergenceFailures** 3 This key gives the maximum
number of convergence failures allowed. Each convergence failure cuts
the timestep in half and the solver tries to advance the solution with
the reduced timestep.

The default value is 3.

Note that setting this value to a value greater than 9 may result in
errors in how time cycles are calculated. Time is discretized in terms
of the base time unit and if the solver begins to take very small
timesteps :math:`smaller than base time unit 1000` the values based
on time cycles will be change at slightly incorrect times. If the
problem is failing converge so poorly that a large number of restarts
are required, consider setting the timestep to a smaller value.

the amount of informational data that is printed to the ``*.out.kinsol.log`` 
file. Choices for this key are **NoVerbosity**, **LowVerbosity**, **NormalVerbosity** 
and **HighVerbosity**. The choice **NoVerbosity** prints no statistics about the 
nonlinear convergence process. The choice **LowVerbosity** outputs the nonlinear 
iteration count, the scaled norm of the nonlinear function, and the number of 
function calls. The choice **NormalVerbosity** prints the same as for **LowVerbosity** 
and also the global strategy statistics. The choice **HighVerbosity** prints the 
same as for **NormalVerbosity** with the addition of further Krylov iteration 
statistics.

the linear system tolerance will be selected. The linear system is
solved until a relative residual reduction of :math:`\eta` is achieved.
Linear residual norms are measured in the :math:`l^2` norm. Choices for
this key include **EtaConstant, Walker1** and **Walker2**. If the choice
**EtaConstant** is specified, then :math:`\eta` will be taken as
constant. The choices **Walker1** and **Walker2** specify choices for
:math:`\eta` developed by Eisenstat and Walker :cite:p:`EW96`.
The choice **Walker1** specifies that :math:`\eta` will be given by
:math:`| \|F(u^k)\| - \|F(u^{k-1}) + J(u^{k-1})*p \|  |  / \|F(u^{k-1})\|`.
The choice **Walker2** specifies that :math:`\eta` will be given by
:math:`\gamma \|F(u^k)\| / \|F(u^{k-1})\|^{\alpha}`. For both of the
last two choices, :math:`\eta` is never allowed to be less than 1e-4.

*string* **Solver.Linear.Preconditioner** MGSemi This key specifies
which preconditioner to use. Currently, the three choices are **NoPC,
MGSemi, PFMG, PFMGOctree** and **SMG**. The choice **NoPC** specifies
that no preconditioner should be used. The choice **MGSemi** specifies a
semi-coarsening multigrid algorithm which uses a point relaxation
method. The choice **SMG** specifies a semi-coarsening multigrid
algorithm which uses plane relaxations. This method is more robust than
**MGSemi**, but generally requires more memory and compute time. The
choice **PFMGOctree** can be more efficient for problems with large
numbers of inactive cells.

CLM Solver Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*string* **Solver.CLM.Print1dOut** False This key specifies 
whether the ``CLM`` one dimensional (averaged over each processor) 
output file is written or not. Choices for this key include True and 
False. Note that ``CLM`` must be compiled and linked at runtime 
for this option to be active.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset Solver.CLM.Print1dOut   False       ## TCL syntax
      <runname>.Solver.CLM.Print1dOut = False   ## Python syntax

*integer* **Solver.CLM.IstepStart** 1 This key specifies the value of
the counter, *istep* in ``CLM``. This key primarily determines the start 
of the output counter for ``CLM``. It is used to restart a run by setting 
the key to the ending step of the previous run plus one. Note 
that ``CLM`` must be compiled and linked at runtime for this option to 
be active.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset Solver.CLM.IstepStart     8761      ## TCL syntax
      <runname>.Solver.CLM.IstepStart = 8761    ## Python syntax   

*String* **Solver.CLM.MetForcing** no default This key specifies defines
whether 1D (uniform over the domain), 2D (spatially distributed) or 3D
(spatially distributed with multiple timesteps per ``.pfb`` forcing file) 
forcing data is used. Choices for this key are **1D**, **2D** and **3D**. This key 
has no default so the user *must* set it to 1D, 2D or 3D. Failure to set 
this key will cause ``CLM`` to still be run but with unpredictable values 
causing ``CLM`` to eventually crash. 1D meteorological forcing files 
are text files with single columns for each variable and each timestep 
per row, while 2D forcing files are distributed ParFlow binary files, one 
for each variable and timestep. File names are specified in the 
**Solver.CLM.MetFileName** variable below. Note that ``CLM`` must be compiled 
and linked at runtime for this option to be active.

.. container:: list

      <runname>.Solver.CLM.MetForcing = "2D"    ## Python syntax

*String* **Solver.CLM.MetFileName** no default This key specifies
defines the file name for 1D, 2D or 3D forcing data. 1D meteorological
forcing files are text files with single columns for each variable and
each timestep per row, while 2D and 3D forcing files are distributed
ParFlow binary files, one for each variable and timestep (2D) or one for
each variable and *multiple* timesteps (3D). Behavior of this key is
different for 1D and 2D and 3D cases, as specified by the
**Solver.CLM.MetForcing** key above. For 1D cases, it is the *FULL FILE
NAME*. Note that in this configuration, this forcing file is **not**
distributed, the user does not provide copies such 
as ``narr.1hr.txt.0``, ``narr.1hr.txt.1`` for each processor. ParFlow only 
needs the single original file (*e.g.* ``narr.1hr.txt``). For 2D cases, this key 
is the BASE FILE NAME for the 2D forcing files, currently set to NLDAS, 
with individual files determined as follows ``NLDAS.<variable>.<time step>.pfb``. 
Where the ``<variable>`` is the forcing variable and ``<timestep>`` is the 
integer file counter corresponding to istep above. Forcing is needed 
for following variables:

**DSWR**: 
   Downward Visible or Short-Wave radiation :math:`[W/m^2]`.

**DLWR**: 
   Downward Infa-Red or Long-Wave radiation :math:`[W/m^2]`

**APCP**: 
   Precipitation rate :math:`[mm/s]`

**Temp**: 
   Air temperature :math:`[K]`

**UGRD**: 
   West-to-East or U-component of wind :math:`[m/s]`

**VGRD**: 
   South-to-North or V-component of wind :math:`[m/s]`

**Press**: 
   Atmospheric Pressure :math:`[pa]`

**SPFH**: 
   Water-vapor specific humidity :math:`[kg/kg]` 

Note that ``CLM`` must be compiled and linked at runtime for this option to be active.

*String* **Solver.CLM.MetFilePath** no default This key specifies
defines the location of 1D, 2D or 3D forcing data. For 1D cases, this is
the path to a single forcing file (*e.g.* ``narr.1hr.txt``). For 2D and 
3D cases, this is the path to the directory containing all forcing files. 
Note that ``CLM`` must be compiled and linked at runtime for this 
option to be active.

*string* **Solver.CLM.ForceVegetation** False This key specifies whether
vegetation should be forced in ``CLM``. Currently this option only works 
for 1D and 3D forcings, as specified by the key ``Solver.CLM.MetForcing``. 
Choices for this key include **True** and **False**. Forced vegetation variables 
are :

**LAI**: 
   Leaf Area Index :math:`[-]`

**SAI**: 
   Stem Area Index :math:`[-]`

**Z0M**: 
   Aerodynamic roughness length :math:`[m]`

**DISPLA**: 
   Displacement height :math:`[m]` 

In the case of 1D meteorological forcings, ``CLM`` requires four files 
for vegetation time series and one vegetation map. The four files should 
be named respectively ``lai.dat``, ``sai.dat``, ``z0m.dat``, ``displa.dat``. 
They are ASCII files and contain 18 time-series columns (one per IGBP 
vegetation class, and each timestep per row). The vegetation map should 
be a properly distributed 2D ParFlow binary file (``.pfb``) which contains 
vegetation indices (from 1 to 18). The vegetation map filename is ``veg_map.pfb``. 
ParFlow uses the vegetation map to pass to ``CLM`` a 2D map for each 
vegetation variable at each time step. In the case of 3D meteorological 
forcings, ParFlow expects four distincts properly distributed ParFlow binary 
file (``.pfb``), the third dimension being the timesteps. The files should 
be named ``LAI.pfb``, ``SAI.pfb``, ``Z0M.pfb``, ``DISPLA.pfb``. No 
vegetation map is needed in this case.

.. _ParFlow NetCDF4 Parallel I/O:

ParFlow NetCDF4 Parallel I/O
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NetCDF4 parallel I/O is being implemented in ParFlow. As of now only
output capability is implemented. Input functionality will be added in
later version. Currently user has option of printing 3-D time varying
pressure or saturation or both in a single NetCDF file containing
multiple time steps. User should configure ParFlow(pfsimulatior 
part) ``--with-netcdf`` option and link the appropriate NetCDF4 library. Naming
convention of output files is analogues to binary file names. Following
options are available for NetCDF4 output along with various performance
tuning options. User is advised to explore NetCDF4 chunking and ROMIO

NetCDF4 Chunking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chunking may have significant impact on I/O. If this key is not set,
default chunking scheme will be used by NetCDF library. Chunks are
hypercube(hyperslab) of any dimension. When chunking is used, chunks are
written in single write operation which can reduce access times. For
more information on chunking, refer to NetCDF4 user guide.

*string* **NetCDF.Chunking** False This key sets chunking for each time
varying 3-D variable in NetCDF4 file.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset NetCDF.Chunking    True       ## TCL syntax
      <runname>.NetCDF.Chunking = True    ## Python syntax

Following keys are used only when **NetCDF.Chunking** is set to true.
These keys are used to set chunk sizes in x, y and z direction. A
typical size of chunk in each direction should be equal to number of
grid points in each direction for each processor. e.g. If we are using a
grid of 400(x)X400(y)X30(z) with 2-D domain decomposition of 8X8, then
each core has 50(x)X50(y)X30(z) grid points. These values can be used to
set chunk sizes each direction. For unequal distribution, chunk sizes
should as large as largest value of grid points on the processor. e.g.
If one processor has grid distribution of 40(x)X40(y)X30(z) and another
has 50(x)X50(y)X30(z), the later values should be used to set chunk
sizes in each direction.

*integer* **NetCDF.ChunkX** None This key sets chunking size in
x-direction.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset NetCDF.ChunkX    50     ## TCL syntax
      <runname>.NetCDF.ChunkX = 50  ## Python syntax

*integer* **NetCDF.ChunkY** None This key sets chunking size in
y-direction.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset NetCDF.ChunkY    50     ## TCL syntax
      <runname>.NetCDF.ChunkY = 50  ## Python syntax

*integer* **NetCDF.ChunkZ** None This key sets chunking size in
z-direction.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset NetCDF.ChunkZ    30        ## TCL syntax
      <runname>.NetCDF.ChunkZ = 30     ## Python syntax


NetCDF4 Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*integer* **NetCDF.Compression** False This key enables in-transit
deflate compression for all NetCDF variables using zlib. To use this
feature, NetCDF4 v4.7.4 must be available, which supports the necessary
parallel zlib compression. The compression quality can be influenced by
the chunk sizes and the overall data distribution. Compressed variables
in NetCDF files can be opened in serial mode also within older versions
of NetCDF4.

::

   pfset NetCDF.Compression True          ## TCL syntax
   <runname>.NetCDF.Compression = True    ## Python syntax

*integer* **NetCDF.CompressionLevel** 1 This key sets the deflate
compression level (if **NetCDF.Compression** is enabled), which influence
the overall compression quality. zlib supports values between 0 (no
compression), 1 (fastest compression) - 9 (slowest compression, smallest
files).

::

   pfset NetCDF.CompressionLevel 1           ## TCL syntax
   <runname>.NetCDF.CompressionLevel = 1     ## Python syntax


ROMIO Hints
~~~~~~~~~~~

ROMIO is a poratable MPI-IO implementation developed at Argonne National
Laboratory, USA. Currently it is released as a part of MPICH. ROMIO sets
hints to optimize I/O operations for MPI-IO layer through MPI_Info
object. This object is passed on to NetCDF4 while creating a file. ROMIO
hints are set in a text file in "key" and "value" pair. *For correct
settings contact your HPC site administrator*. As in chunking, ROMIO
hints can have significant performance impact on I/O.

*string* **NetCDF.ROMIOhints** None This key sets ROMIO hints file to be
passed on to NetCDF4 interface. If this key is set, the file must be
present and readable in experiment directory.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset NetCDF.ROMIOhints "romio.hints"         ## TCL syntax
      <runname>.NetCDF.ROMIOhints = "romio.hints"   ## Python syntax

An example ROMIO hints file looks as follows.

.. container:: list

   ::

      romio_ds_write disable
      romio_ds_read disable
      romio_cb_write enable
      romio_cb_read enable
      cb_buffer_size 33554432

Node Level Collective I/O
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A node level collective strategy has been implemented for I/O. One
process on each compute node gathers the data, indices and counts from
the participating processes on same compute node. All the root processes
from each compute node open a parallel NetCDF4 file and write the data.
e.g. If ParFlow is running on 3 compute nodes where each node consists
of 24 processors(cores); only 3 I/O streams to filesystem would be
opened by each root processor each compute node. This strategy could be
particularly useful when ParFlow is running on large number of
processors and every processor participating in I/O may create a
bottleneck. **Node level collective I/O is currently implemented for 2-D
domain decomposition and variables Pressure and Saturation only. All the
other ParFlow NetCDF output Tcl flags should be set to false(default
value). CLM output is independently handled and not affected by this
key. Moreover on speciality architectures, this may not be a portable
feature. Users are advised to test this feature on their machine before
putting into production.**

*string* **NetCDF.NodeLevelIO** False This key sets flag for node level
collective I/O.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset NetCDF.NodeLevelIO   True        ## TCL syntax
      <runname>.NetCDF.NodeLevelIO = True    ## Python syntax

NetCDF4 Initial Conditions: Pressure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Analogues to ParFlow binary files, NetCDF4 based option can be used to
set the initial conditions for pressure to be read from an “nc" file
containing single time step of pressure. The name of the variable in
“nc" file should be “pressure". A sample NetCDF header of an initial
condition file looks as follows. The names of the dimensions are not
important. The order of dimensions is important e.g. *(time, lev, lat,
lon) or (time,z, y, x)*

.. container:: list

   ::

      netcdf initial_condition {
      dimensions:
      	x = 200 ;
      	y = 200 ;
      	z = 40 ;
      	time = UNLIMITED ; 
      variables:
      	double time(time) ;
      	double pressure(time, z, y, x) ;
      }

**Node level collective I/O is currently not implemented for setting
initial conditions.**

*string* **ICPressure.Type** no default This key sets flag for initial
conditions to be read from a NetCDF file.

NetCDF4 files may have more than one timestep in the file.   By default the first
timestep will be read.  The TimeStep attribute is used to specify the timestep
to be used for the initial pressure.   Negative values are allowed to index
from the end.   "-1" is often a useful index to read the last timestep
in the file.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset ICPressure.Type   "NCFile"        ## TCL syntax  
      pfset Geom.domain.ICPressure.FileName "initial_condition.nc" ## TCL syntax
      pfset Geom.domain.ICPressure.TimeStep -1 ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.ICPressure.Type = "NCFile"    ## Python syntax
      <runname>.Geom.domain.ICPressure.FileName = "initial_condition.nc" ## Python syntax
      <runname>.Geom.domain.ICPressure.TimeStep = -1 ## Python syntax

NetCDF4 Slopes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NetCDF4 based option can be used slopes to be read from an “nc" file
containing single time step of slope values. The name of the variable in
“nc" file should be “slopex" and “slopey" A sample NetCDF header of
slope file looks as follows. The names of the dimensions are not
important. The order of dimensions is important e.g. *(time, lat, lon)
or (time, y, x)*

.. container:: list

   ::

      netcdf slopex {
      dimensions:
      	time = UNLIMITED ; // (1 currently)
      	lon = 41 ;
      	lat = 41 ;
      variables:
      	double time(time) ;
      	double slopex(time, lat, lon) ;
      }
      netcdf slopey {
      dimensions:
      	time = UNLIMITED ; // (1 currently)
      	lon = 41 ;
      	lat = 41 ;
      variables:
      	double time(time) ;
      	double slopey(time, lat, lon) ;
      }

The two NetCDF files can be merged into one single file and can be used
with tcl flags. The variable names should be exactly as mentioned above.
Please refer to “slopes.nc" under Little Washita test case. **Node level
collective I/O is currently not implemented for setting initial
conditions.**

*string* **TopoSlopesX.Type** no default This key sets flag for slopes
in x direction to be read from a NetCDF file.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset TopoSlopesX.Type "NCFile"              ## TCL syntax
      pfset TopoSlopesX.FileName "slopex.nc"       ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.TopoSlopesX.Type = "NCFile"        ## Python syntax
      <runname>.TopoSlopesX.FileName = "slopex.nc" ## Python syntax

*string* **TopoSlopesY.Type** no default This key sets flag for slopes
in y direction to be read from a NetCDF file.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset TopoSlopesY.Type "NCFile"              ## TCL syntax
      pfset TopoSlopesy.FileName "slopey.nc"       ## TCL syntax

      <runname>.TopoSlopesY.Type = "NCFile"        ## Python syntax
      <runname>.TopoSlopesy.FileName = "slopey.nc" ## Python syntax

NetCDF4 Transient EvapTrans Forcing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following keys can be used for NetCDF4 based transient evaptrans
forcing. The file should contain forcing for all time steps. For a given
time step, if the forcing is null, zero values could be filled for the
given time step in the “.nc" file. The format of the sample file looks
as follows. The names of the dimensions are not important. The order of
dimensions is important e.g. *(time, lev, lat, lon) or (time,z, y, x)*

.. container:: list

   ::

      netcdf evap_trans {
      dimensions:
      	time = UNLIMITED ; // (1000 currently)
      	x = 72 ;
      	y = 72 ;
      	z = 3 ;
      variables:
      	double evaptrans(time, z, y, x) ;
      }

**Node level collective I/O is currently not implemented for transient
evaptrans forcing.**

*string* **NetCDF.EvapTransFileTransient** False This key sets flag for
transient evaptrans forcing to be read from a NetCDF file.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset NetCDF.EvapTransFileTransient True           ## TCL syntax

*string* **NetCDF.EvapTrans.FileName** no default This key sets the name
of the NetCDF transient evaptrans forcing file.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset NetCDF.EvapTrans.FileName "evap_trans.nc"          ## TCL syntax
      <runname>.NetCDF.EvapTrans.FileName = "evap_trans.nc"    ## Python syntax

output CLM variables in a single NetCDF file containing multiple time
steps.

*integer* **NetCDF.CLMNumStepsPerFile** None This key sets number of
time steps to be written to a single NetCDF file.

.. container:: list

   ::

      pfset NetCDF.CLMNumStepsPerFile 24           ## TCL syntax
      <runname>.NetCDF.CLMNumStepsPerFile = 24     ## Python syntax

   ``t_soil`` for soil temperature over all layers :math:`[K]` using the silo variable *TemperatureSoil*.

NetCDF4 CLM Input/Forcing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| NetCDF based meteorological forcing can be used with following TCL
  keys. It is built similar to 2D forcing case for CLM with parflow
  binary files. All the required forcing variables must be present in
  one single NetCDF file spanning entire length of simulation. If the
  simulation ends before number of time steps in NetCDF forcing file,
  next cycle of simulation can be restarted with same forcing file
  provided it covers the time span of this cycle.
| e.g. If the NetCDF forcing file contains 100 time steps and simulation
  CLM-ParFlow simulation runs for 10 cycles containing 10 time steps in
  each cycle, the same forcing file can be reused. The user has to set
  correct value for the key ``Solver.CLM.IstepStart``
| The format of input file looks as follows. The variable names should
  match exactly as follows. The names of the dimensions are not
  important. The order of dimensions is important e.g. *(time, lev, lat,
  lon) or (time,z, y, x)*

.. container:: list

   ::

      netcdf metForcing {
      dimensions:
      	lon = 41 ;
      	lat = 41 ;

      variables:
      	double time(time) ;
      	double APCP(time, lat, lon) ;
      	double DLWR(time, lat, lon) ;
      	double DSWR(time, lat, lon) ;

      	double Temp(time, lat, lon) ;
      	double UGRD(time, lat, lon) ;
      	double VGRD(time, lat, lon) ;

**Note: While using NetCDF based CLM forcing,** ``Solver.CLM.MetFileNT``
**should be set to its default value of 1**

*string* **Solver.CLM.MetForcing** no default This key sets
meteorological forcing to be read from NetCDF file.
