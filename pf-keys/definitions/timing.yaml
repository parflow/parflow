  BaseUnit:
    help: >
      [Type: double] This key is used to indicate the base unit of time for entering time values. All time should be expressed as a
      multiple of this value. This should be set to the smallest interval of time to be used in the problem. For example, a
      base unit of “1” means that all times will be integer valued. A base unit of “0.5” would allow integers and fractions
      of 0.5 to be used for time input values.
      The rationale behind this restriction is to allow time to be discretized on some interval to enable integer arithmetic
      to be used when computing/comparing times. This avoids the problems associated with real value comparisons which
      can lead to events occurring at different timesteps on different architectures or compilers.
      This value is also used when describing “time cycling data” in, currently, the well and boundary condition sections.
      The lengths of the cycles in those sections will be integer multiples of this value, therefore it needs to be the smallest
      divisor which produces an integral result for every “real time” cycle interval length needed.

  StartCount:
    help: >
      [Type: int] This key is used to indicate the time step number that will be associated with the first advection cycle in a
      transient problem. The value -1 indicates that advection is not to be done. The value 0 indicates that advection
      should begin with the given initial conditions. Values greater than 0 are intended to mean “restart” from some
      previous “checkpoint” time-step, but this has not yet been implemented.

  DumpInterval:
    help: >
      [Type: double] This key is the real time interval at which time-dependent output should be written. A value of 0 will produce
      undefined behavior. If the value is negative, output will be dumped out every n time steps, where n is the absolute
      value of the integer part of the value.

  DumpIntervalExecutionTimeLimit:
    help: >
      [Type: int] This key is used to indicate a wall clock time to halt the execution of a run. At the end of each dump interval
      the time remaining in the batch job is compared with the user supplied value, if remaining time is less than or equal
      to the supplied value the execution is halted. Typically used when running on batch systems with time limits to force
      a clean shutdown near the end of the batch job. Time units is seconds, a value of 0 (the default) disables the check.
      Currently only supported on SLURM based systems, “–with-slurm” must be specified at configure time to enable.
