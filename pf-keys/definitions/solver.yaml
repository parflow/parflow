      [Type: string] ParFlow can operate using a number of different solvers. Two of these solvers, IMPES
      (running in single-phase, fully-saturated mode, not multiphase) and RICHARDS (running in variably-saturated mode, not
      multiphase, with the options of land surface processes and coupled overland flow) are detailed below. This is
      a brief summary of solver settings used to simulate under three sets of conditions, fully-saturated, variably saturated
      and variably-saturated with overland flow. To simulate fully saturated, steady-state conditions set
      the solver to IMPES. This is also the default solver in ParFlow, so if no solver is specified, the code solves using IMPES.
      To simulate variably-saturated, transient conditions, using Richards’ equation, variably/fully saturated,
      transient with compressible storage set the solver to RICHARDS. This is also the
      solver used to simulate surface flow or coupled surface-subsurface flow.

    ForceVegetation:

        [Type: boolean/string] This key specifies whether vegetation should be forced in CLM. Currently this option only works for 1D and 3D
        forcings, as specified by the key Solver.CLM.MetForcing. Choices for this key include True and False. Forced
        vegetation variables are :
        LAI: Leaf Area Index [-]

        Z0M: Aerodynamic roughness length [m]
        DISPLA: Displacement height [m]
        In the case of 1D meteorological forcings, CLM requires four files for vegetation time series and one vegetation map.
        The four files should be named respectively lai.dat, sai.dat, z0m.dat, displa.dat. They are ASCII files and
        contain 18 time-series columns (one per IGBP vegetation class, and each timestep per row). The vegetation map
        should be a properly distributed 2D ParFlow binary file (.pfb) which contains vegetation indices (from 1 to 18).
        The vegetation map filename is veg_map.pfb. ParFlow uses the vegetation map to pass to CLM a 2D map for each
        vegetation variable at each time step. In the case of 3D meteorological forcings, ParFlow expects four distincts
        properly distributed ParFlow binary file (.pfb), the third dimension being the timesteps. The files should be named
        LAI.pfb, SAI.pfb, Z0M.pfb, DISPLA.pfb. No vegetation map is needed in this case.

        currently set to NLDAS, with individual files determined as follows NLDAS.<variable>.<time step>.pfb. Where the
        <variable> is the forcing variable and <timestep> is the integer file counter corresponding to istep above. Forcing
