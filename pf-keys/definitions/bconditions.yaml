      the coordinate locations and h will specify the hydraulic head value of the condition. This real location is “snapped”
      to the nearest gridpoint in ParFlow. NOTE: Currently, ParFlow assumes that internal boundary conditions and pressure wells are separated by at
      least one cell from any external boundary. The user should be careful of this when defining the input file and grid.

    Here we define the pressure boundary conditions. The Dirichlet conditions below are hydrostatic conditions, and it is
    assumed that at each phase interface the pressure is constant. It is also assumed here that all phases are distributed
    within the domain at all times such that the lighter phases are vertically higher than the heavier phases.
    Boundary condition input is associated with domain patches. Note that different patches may have
    different types of boundary conditions on them.

      # typo in manual - OverlandFow should be OverlandFlow
      Type:
        help: >
          [Type: string] This key specifies the type of boundary condition data given for patch patch_name. Possible values for this key
          are DirEquilRefPatch, DirEquilPLinear, FluxConst, FluxVolumetric, PressureFile, FluxFile, OverlandFlow,
          OverlandFlowPFB, SeepageFace, OverlandKinematic, OverlandDiffusive and ExactSolution.
          The choice DirEquilRefPatch specifies that the pressure on the specified patch will be in hydrostatic equilibrium
          with a constant reference pressure given on a reference patch. The choice DirEquilPLinear specifies that the pressure
          on the specified patch will be in hydrostatic equilibrium with pressure given along a piecewise line at elevation
          z = 0. The choice FluxConst defines a constant normal flux boundary condition through the domain patch. This
          flux must be specified in units of [L]=[T]. For Richards’ equation, fluxes must be specified as a mass flux and given as
          the above flux multiplied by the density. Thus, this choice of input type for a Richards’ equation problem has units of
          ([L]=[T])([M]=[L]3). The choice FluxVolumetric defines a volumetric flux boundary condition through the domain
          patch. The units should be consistent with all other user input for the problem. For Richards’ equation fluxes must
          be specified as a mass flux and given as the above flux multiplied by the density. The choice PressureFile defines
          a hydraulic head boundary condition that is read from a properly distributed .pfb file. Only the values needed for
          the patch are used. The choice FluxFile defines a flux boundary condition that is read form a properly distributed
          .pfb file defined on a grid consistent with the pressure field grid. Only the values needed for the patch are used. The
          choices OverlandFlow and OverlandFlowPFB both turn on fully-coupled overland flow routing as described in
          [40] and in § 5.5. The key OverlandFlow corresponds to a Value key with a positive or negative value, to indicate
          uniform fluxes (such as rainfall or evapotranspiration) over the entire domain while the key OverlandFlowPFB allows
          a .pfb file to contain grid-based, spatially-variable fluxes. The OverlandKinematic and OverlandDiffusive
          both turn on an kinematic and diffusive wave overland flow routing boundary that solve equation 5.18 and do the
          upwinding internally (i.e. assuming that the user provides cell face slopes, as opposed to the traditional cell centered
          slopes). The key SeepageFace simulates a boundary that allows flow to exit but keeps the surface pressure at zero.
          The choice ExactSolution specifies that an exact known solution is to be applied as a Dirichlet boundary condition
          on the respective patch. Note that this does not change according to any cycle. Instead, time dependence is handled
          by evaluating at the time the boundary condition value is desired. The solution is specified by using a predefined
          function (choices are described below). NOTE: These last six types of boundary condition input is for Richards’
          equation cases only!
