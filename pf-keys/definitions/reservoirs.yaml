        [Type: bool] This key specifies if the reservoir has a secondary intake cell, 
        with 0 evaluating to false and 1 evaluating to true. This cell will always be 
        placed on the domain surface.

    Max_Storage:

      help: >
        [Type: double] This key specifies a reservoir's maximum storage. If storage rises above this value, a 
        reservoir will release extra water if necessary to get back down to this amount by the next timestep.
      domains:
        DoubleValue:

    Storage:

      help: >
        [Type: double] This key specifies the amount of water stored in the reservoir as a volume. Has same length
        units as the problem domain i.e. if domain is sized in meters this will be in m^3
      domains:
        DoubleValue:

    Release_Rate:
      help: >
        [Type: double] This key specifies the rate in volume/time [L^3 T^-1] that the reservoir release water.
        The amount of time over which this amount is released is independent of solver timestep size
      domains:
        DoubleValue:

  Overland_Flow_Solver:
    help: >
      [Type: string] This key specifies which overland flow condition is used in the domain so that the slopes around
      the reservoirs can be adjusted properly. Supported Options are OverlandFlow and OverlandKinematic.
