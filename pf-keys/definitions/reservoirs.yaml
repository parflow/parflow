        reservoir and another being an injection reservoir. The extraction reservoir filters out a specified fraction of each contaminant and
        recirculates the remainder to the injection reservoir where the diluted fluid is injected back in. The phase saturations at
        the extraction reservoir are passed without modification to the injection reservoir.

        [Type: string] This key specifies a method by which pressure or flux for an injection reservoir will be weighted before assignment
        to computational cells. This key can only be Standard if the type key is set to Pressure; or this key can be
        either Standard, Weighted or Patterned if the type key is set to Flux. A value of Standard indicates that the
        pressure or flux data will be used as is. A value of Weighted indicates that the flux data is to be weighted by the
        cells permeability divided by the sum of all cell permeabilities which define the reservoir. The value of Patterned is not
        implemented.
