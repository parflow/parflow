/**
 *
 * The collective operation \Ref{amps_BCast} is used to communicate
 * information from one node to all the other nodes who are members
 * of a context.  {\bf rank} is the rank of the node that contains
 * the information to be communicated.  {\bf comm} is the communication
 * context (group of nodes) that should receive the information.
 *
 * In order to allow more symmetry in the code on the source and destination
 * nodes, overlay-ed variables are valid after an \Ref{amps_BCast} until a
 * \Ref{amps_Clear} is invoked on both the source and destination
 * nodes.  This differs from some systems were the buffer is considered
 * destroyed on the source node once the broadcast is invoked.
 *
 * {\large Example:}
 * \begin{verbatim}
 * amps_Invoice invoice;
 * int length, source_rank;
 * char *string;
 *
 * me = amps_Rank(amps_CommWorld);
 *
 * if(me == source_rank)
 * {
 *      // source knows the length
 *      length = strlen(string)+1;
 *      invoice = amps_NewInvoice("%i%*c", &length, length, string);
 * }
 * else
 * {
 *      // receiving nodes do not know length so user overlayed variable
 *      invoice = amps_NewInvoice("%i%&\%", &length, &length, &recvd_string);
 * }
 *
 * // broadcast a character array and it's length
 * amps_BCast(amps_CommWorld, source_rank, invoice);
 *
 * amps_FreeInvoice(invoice);
 * \end{verbatim}
 *
 * @memo Send to all nodes
 * @param comm communication context for the broadcast [IN]
 * @param source rank of the node that is sending [IN]
 * @param invoice the data to send [IN/OUT]
 * @return Error code
