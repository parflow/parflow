/**
 *
 * The \Ref{amps_FFopen} command is used to open a fixed file.  This
 * file is written to and read from using the \Ref{amps_Fprintf},
 * \Ref{amps_Fscanf}, \Ref{amps_ReadType}, and
 * \Ref{amps_WriteType} commands just as you would for a normal
 * UNIX file.  You must ensure that the distributed file exists on all
 * nodes before attempting to open it for reading.  Two arguments to
 * \Ref{amps_FFopen} are the same as for {\bf fopen}: {\bf filename} is
 * the name of the file to and {\bf type} is the mode to open.
 * {\bf comm} is the communicator that specifies the nodes which are
 * opening the file, {\bf size} specifies the size (in bytes) of the
 * local contribution to the total size of the file.  {\bf size} is not
 * used when doing an open for a read (the information is in the
 * associated {\bf .dist} file).
 *
 * The macros \Ref{amps_Sizeof} are used to
 * determine the size (in bytes) of the standard C types.  You should not
 * use the Standard C {\bf sizeof} routine since {\em AMPS} writes
 * binary output using {\em XDR} format (\cite{xdr.87}).
 *
 * \Ref{amps_FFopen} returns NULL if the the file open fails.
 *
 * {\large Example:}
 * \begin{verbatim}
 * amps_File file;
 *
 * char *filename;
 * double d;
 *
 * file = amps_FFopen(amps_CommWorld, filename, "wb", amps_SizeofDouble);
 *
 * amps_WriteDouble(file, &d, 1);
 *
 * amps_FFclose(file);
 *
 * \end{verbatim}
 *
 * {\large Notes:}
 *
 * There should be some commands to take a normal file and distribute it to
 * the nodes.  This presents a problem since {\em AMPS} does not know how
 * you want to split up the file to the nodes.  This is being worked on;
 * basically the {\em AMPS} I/O calls are a hack until some standard can
 * be arrived at.  The functionality is sufficient for {\em ParFlow} at
 * the current time.
 *
 * When you are reading/writing to a file with binary data be sure and
 * use the ``b'' to signal a binary file.  This is used for portability to
 * the Win32 where binary and text files are treated differently.  Most
 * UNIX programmers do not use this feature of the ANSI C standard.
 *
 * @memo Open fixed size file
 * @param comm Communication context [IN]
 * @param filename name of the file [IN]
 * @param type fopen like type string [IN]
 * @param size size of this nodes contribution to the file [IN]
 * @return File handle or NULL
