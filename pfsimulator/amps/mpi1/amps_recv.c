 * \Ref{amps_Recv} is a blocking receive operation.  It receives a message
 * from the node with {\bf rank} within the {\bf comm} context.  This
 * operation will not return until the receive operation has been
 * completed.  The received data is unpacked into the the data locations
 * specified in the {\bf invoice}.  After the return it is legal to access
 * overlayed variables (which must be freed with \Ref{amps_Clear}).
 *
 * {\large Example:}
 * \begin{verbatim}
 * amps_Invoice invoice;
 * int me, i;
 * double d;
 *
 * me = amps_Rank(amps_CommWorld);
 *
 * invoice = amps_NewInvoice("%i%d", &i, &d);
 *
 * amps_Send(amps_CommWorld, me+1, invoice);
 *
 * amps_Recv(amps_CommWorld, me-1, invoice);
 *
 * amps_FreeInvoice(invoice);
 * \end{verbatim}
 *
 * {\large Notes:}
 *
 * @memo Blocking receive
 * @param comm Communication context [IN]
 * @param source Node rank to receive from [IN]
 * @param invoice Data to receive [IN/OUT]
