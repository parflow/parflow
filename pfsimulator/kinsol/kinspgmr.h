*----------------------------------------------------------------*
* The user-supplied preconditioner setup function precondset and *
* the user-supplied preconditioner solve function precondsolve   *
* together must define the right preconditioner matrix P chosen  *
* so as to provide an easier system for the Krylov solver        *
* to solve. precondset is called to provide any matrix data      *
* required by the subsequent call(s) to precondsolve. The data is*
* stored in the memory allocated to P_data and the structuring of*
* that memory is up to the user.     More specifically,          *
* the user-supplied preconditioner setup function precondset     *
* is to evaluate and preprocess any Jacobian-related data        *
* needed by the preconditioner solve function precondsolve.      *
* This might include forming a crude approximate Jacobian,       *
* and performing an LU factorization on the resulting            *
* approximation to J.  This function will not be called in       *
* advance of every call to precondsolve, but instead will be     *
* called only as often as necessary to achieve convergence       *
* within the Newton iteration in KINSol.  If the precondsolve    *
* function needs no preparation, the precondset function can be  *
* NULL.                                                          *
*                                                                *
* precondset should not modify the contents of the arrays        *
* uu or fval as those arrays are used elsewhere in the           *
* iteration process.                                             *
*                                                                *
* Each call to the precondset function is preceded by a call to  *
* the system function func. Thus the precondset function can use *
* any auxiliary data that is computed by the func function and   *
* saved in a way accessible to precondset.                       *
*                                                                *
* The two scaling arrays, fscale and uscale, and unit roundoff   *
* uround are provided to the precondset function for possible use*
* in approximating Jacobian data, e.g. by difference quotients.  *
* These arrays should also not be altered                        *
*                                                                *

*----------------------------------------------------------------*
* A call to the KINSpgmr function links the main KINSol solver   *
* with the KINSpgmr linear solver. Among other things, it sets   *
* the generic names linit, lsetup, lsolve, and lfree to the      *
* specific names for this package:                               *

* kin_mem is the pointer to KINSol memory returned by            *
*             KINSolMalloc.                                      *
*                                                                *
* maxl      is the maximum Krylov dimension. This is an          *
*             optional input to the KINSpgmr solver. Pass 0 to   *
*             use the default value MIN(Neq, KINSPGMR_MAXL=10).  *
*                                                                *
* maxlrst   is the maximum number of linear solver restarts      *
*            allowed. Values outside the range 0 to 2*Neq/maxl   *
*            will be restricted to that range. 0, meaning no     *
*            restarts is a safe starting value.                  *
*                                                                *
* msbpre    is the maximum number of steps calling the solver    *
*           precondsolve without calling the preconditioner      *
*           precondset. (The default is KINSPGMR_MSBPRE = 10)    *
*                                                                *
* precondset  is the user's preconditioner routine. It is used to*
*             evaluate and preprocess any Jacobian-related data  *
*             needed by the precondsolve routine.  See the       *
*             documentation for the type KINSpgmrPrecondFn for   *
*             full details.  Pass NULL if no such setup of       *
*             Jacobian data is required.  A precond routine is   *
*             NOT required, but rather provided when needed by   *
*             user's precondsolve routine                        *
*                                                                *
* precondsolve  is the user's preconditioner solve routine. It   *
*             is used to solve Px=b, where P is a preconditioner *
*             matrix.  See the documentation for the type        *
*             KINSpgmrPrecondSolveFn for full details.  The only *
*              case in which psolve is allowed to be NULL is when*
*             no preconditioning is to be done. The NULL is taken*
*             as a flag that preconditioning is not desired.     *
*                                                                *
* userAtimes  is an optional routine supplied by the user to     *
*             perform the matrix-vector multiply J v, where J is *
*             an approximate Jacobian matrix for that iteration. *
*             Enter NULL if no such routine is required. If one  *
*             is supplied, conforming to the definitions given   *
*             in this file, enter its function name.             *
*                                                                *
* P_data      is a pointer to user preconditioner data. This     *
*             pointer is passed to precondset and precondsolve   *
*             every time these routines are called.              *
*                                                                *
*       KINSpgmr returns an integer that is one of the following *
*       defined constants:                                       *
*            SUCCESS, KIN_MEM_NULL, KINSPGMR_MEM_FAIL, and       *
*            SPGMR_MEM_FAIL.                                     *
