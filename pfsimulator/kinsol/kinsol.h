 *----------------------------------------------------------------*
 * KINSol initializes memory for a problem previously allocated by*
 * a call to KINMalloc. It also checks the initial value of uu    *
 * (the initial guess) against the constraints and checks if the  *
 * initial guess is a solution of the system. It then attempts to *
 * solve the system func(uu) = 0. , where the function func is    *
 * supplied by the user. The Newton-Krylov iterations are stopped *
 * if either func(uu) is smaller in norm than fnormtol            *
 * (see below), or the scaled difference between successive       *
 * iterates is smaller in norm than scsteptol (see below).        *
 * However, the second termination may mean the iterations have   *
 * stalled at a point that is not near a root.                    *
 * The input arguments for KINSol and their                       *
 * function are described below:                                  *

*  SUCCESS :    means maxnorm(fscale*func(uu) <= fnormtol, where *
*               maxnorm() is the maximum norm function N_VMaxNorm*
*               uu is probably an approximate root of func.      *

*  INITIAL_GUESS_OK: means the initial guess uu has been found   *
*               to already satisfy the system to the desired     *
*               accuracy. No calculation was performed other     *

*               two steps is less than scsteptol.  uu may be an  *
*               approximate root of func, but it is also possible*
*               that the algorithm is making very slow progress  *
*               and is not near a root or that scsteptol is too  *

*  LNSRCH_NONCONV: means the LineSearch module failed to reduce  *

*               Either uu is close to a root of f and no more    *
*               accuracy is possible, or the finite-difference   *
*               approximation to j*v is inaccurate, or scsteptol *
*               is too large. Check the outputs ncfl and nni: if *
*               ncfl is close to nni, it may be the case that the*
*               Krylov iteration is converging very slowly. In   *

*               to satisfy the beta condition in the linesearch  *
