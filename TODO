Update manual to reflect the change to the makefile.   "make install" is now the default behavior.

There were some compile problems with the CLM F90 and gfortran,
flagged with "SGS" in the CLM directory.  All had to do with file
open/write statements. A couple of the write statements were simply
commented out to get things to compile.

The PFMG and SMG solvers should be updated to use the setbox hypre
methods for copying data.   Should speed things up a bit.

The current communication setup causes memory errors because we are
setting up communication paterns which don't apply.  E.G. vector
update all2 should only be setup for variables with ghost width of 2.

Possible fix would be to keep stencil width of communication mode around
and only build valid ones.   Would also be good to prevent uses that
would not work.

SAMRAI vector for mg_semi are too big, use PF mechansims instead.

Manual: all new test cases (e.g. CLM) not in manual
Manual: all new keys for pftools (top bddy, conversions, silo) not in manual
Manual: would be nice to have a short section mentioning silo libs and hypre libs
